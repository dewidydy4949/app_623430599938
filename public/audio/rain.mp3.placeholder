# Rain Audio Test File

This is a placeholder for `rain.mp3`. 

## How to add actual rain audio:

1. **Download rain audio:**
   - Go to: https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/rain/
   - Search for "gentle rain" or "rain ambient"
   - Download a high-quality MP3 file (preferably 10+ minutes for looping)

2. **Alternative sources:**
   - https://freesound.org/search/?q=rain
   - https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/rain/
   - https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music (search for rain sounds)

3. **Place the file:**
   - Save the downloaded file as `rain.mp3` in this directory
   - Recommended format: MP3, 320kbps, 44.1kHz
   - Ideal duration: 10-30 minutes for seamless looping

4. **Test the audio:**
   - Replace this placeholder file with actual `rain.mp3`
   - The app will automatically use this local file instead of the Google Sounds API

## File specifications:
- Format: MP3
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz
- Bitrate: 128-320kbps
- Duration: 10+ minutes recommended
- File size: ~10-50MB for good quality

## Current audio configuration:
The app is configured to use:
1. Local `/audio/rain.mp3` (this placeholder needs to be replaced)
2. Fallback to Google Sounds API: `https://actions.google.com/sounds/v1/weather/rain_heavy_loud.ogg`

Replace this file with actual rain audio to test local audio playback.
